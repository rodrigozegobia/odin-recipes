    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Everyone loves some crusty cheese and pasta, but this isn't just any cheesy recipe.<br>
    The lasagna certainly makes us feel italian for a day! Mamma Mia!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>½ cup warm water</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced black olives</li>
        <li>1 pinch basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried sage</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried onion flakes</li>
        <li>2 (14 ounce) jars marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>8 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>       
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
            Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and black olives, and season with basil, garlic<br>
            powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 15<br>
            minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover<br>
            with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, and<br>
            sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce, and repeat<br>
            layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella<br>
            cheese for later.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes depending on<br>
            how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife into it.<br>
            Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and return to the oven for about 10<br>
            minutes for a nice melted cheese topping.</p></li>
    </ol>
